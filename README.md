# Studio Icons (Visual Studio Code Icon Theme)
Featuring official icons from the [Visual Studio 2015 Image Library](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms246582.aspx). These icons have been color optimized to work well for dark, light, and high contrast themes. I welcome any feedback or suggestions.

**NOTE:** High Contrast icons do not currently render for the High Contrast theme. A VS Code patch is in the works. [track progress](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14243#event-833916052)

## Build

Uses Yarn package manager and Gulp for build tasks. Current workflow:

1. Add .svg icon file to /src/svg/
2. Run ``gulp`` on the command line to run default task.

## Thanks

Thanks to Philipp Kief's for the much appreciated [Material Icon Theme](https://github.com/PKief/vscode-extension-material-icon-theme)! Used this as a great starting point for mapping icons to extensions/filenames.

Thanks to the Microsoft team for their excellent icon set!
